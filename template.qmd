# Background

## Question 1: Can Eating disorder be considered as a network?

1.   Dynamic development among emotion regulation, interpersonal problems, and eating disorder being considered as a network has theoretical background.

- Emotion regulation theory suggests emotion regulation issues may results in the development of ED

- Interpersonal psychotherapy theory (IPT) suggests that interpersonal problems may contribute to ED

2.  Previous research has examined the network-like structure of ED

-   Some studies considered the development of ED as a dynamic process
-   Some argue that the relations between risky factors (emotion, interpersonal relations) and ED are complex (i.e., feedback loop)
-   Boys or girls may differ regarding the developmental process of ED

## Question 2: Why psychological network can be used for this topic?

[longitudinal network analysis]{.underline} can be a suitable statistical tool for the problems mentioned previously for following reasons.

1. It consider symptoms related to each other, which constitutes to a *symptom network*
2. It can interpret the complex relationships by identifying the most important factors in this complex network
3. It can compare the group-level network structures, which other models can hardly do 

## More Details about longitudinal network analysis

-   The **graphical vector autoregressive** (GVAR; Epskamp, 2020; Wild et al., 2010) analysis was used to estimate the networks.

-   Three types of network structures are estimated by longitudinal network analysis

    -   Temporal network

    -   Contemporal network

    -   Between-individual network

## Question 3:  How to examine group difference in the networks analysis

In network analysis, groups can be compared from three aspects:

1.  Network structure
2.  Node-level measures: node centrality (importance) or node bridging strength
3.  Network edge weights

## Research Questions:

1.  Are there any gender differences in the **network structures**, or in the **central and bridging symptoms** observed in the cross-sectional networks of eating disorders
2.  How about the longitudinal networks of eating disorders (We only show this today)

## Data

-   4-wave data collection were conducted over 18 months.

-   For each wave, demographic information and self-reported answers of three questionnaires (emotional regulation, interpersonal problems, and eating disorder) from 1652 high school students in China were collected.

-   After data cleaning, N = 1540 cases left including 53.9% girls and 46.1% boys

-   Age ranges from 11 to 17 years with a mean 15.2 years old

## Measures

For network analysis, we used subscales and items as nodes.

1.  **Emotion regulation**: Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-18). 6 subscales measures different aspects of emotion dysregualtion: Awareness, Clarity, Goals, Non-acceptance, Impulse, Strategies
2.  **Interpersonal problems**: Inventory of Interpersonal Problemsâ€”Short Circumplex (IIP-SC). 8 subscales were included measuring varied aspects of interpersonal problems: domineering, cold, avoidant etc.
3.  **Eating disorder**: 12-item short form of Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-QS). 12 items measured different disordered eating behaviors.

## Data Analysis

### 1. Node selection

-   For emotion regulation and interpersonal problem questions, 14 subscales were selected because their measured constructs have been well examined and theory-driven.

-   For eating disorder, we want to makre sure each item represent one unique eating disorder problem. Thus, we used the *goldbricker* algorithm to drop overalapping (dupplicated) symptoms, which give rise to 8 items included in the analyzed network.

### 2. Network estimation

-   Multi-group GVAR was applied to the data to estimate boys' and girls' temporal/contemporary/between-subject network.

-   Furthermore, we pruned the networks and identify the most important nodes and edges using *prune* function in *psychonetric* package in R.

## Data Analysis (Cont.)

### 3. Overall network evaluation

-   Network stability measured by correlation stability (CS) coefficients

### 4. Test the significance of group differences

-   Using [likelihood ratio test]{.underline} (LRT) to examine network structure differences by gender

    -   Model H0 (the model with all edge weights constrained to be equal)

    -   Model H1 (the model with all edge weights freely estimated)

    -   Calculate the likelihood ratio between Model H0 and H1 and perform significance test

-   Examine gender differences in node centrality and bridging strength

    -   Compare estimated node centrality and bridge strength by gender

    -   Accuracy: test the accuracy of node centrality differences using bootstrapping sampling

# Results

## Overall Network Model Checking

1.  The multigroup network stability statistics were all acceptable for contemporary/between-subject networks according to the criteria of CS coefficients above 0.7
2.  The temporal network was less stable with CS coefficients ranging from **.51** to **.56**

3.  Node *weight/shape preoccupation* (EDE-WP) exhibited the highest **InStrength**
4.  Node *weight/shape dissatisfaction* (EDE-WD) exhibited the highest **OutStrength**
5.  Node *Awareness* (Awr) exhibited the highest **bridge strength**

**Are the node differences due to the sampling error? We used bootstrapping method to test that:**

1. *Long periods without eating* (EDE-WE) and *Food preoccupation* (EDE-FP) have significant gender differences in node Outstrength
2. *Weight/shape control by vomiting or taking laxatives* (EDE-VT) have significant gender differences in node InStrength

2. *Weight/shape preoccupation* (EDE-WP) and *Binge eating episode* (EDE-BE) have higher bridge strength in boys than girls.

## Discussion

### Commonality between gender-level network

1.  Weight strength of temporal network are similar for boys and girls, suggesting symptoms have similars impact on other symptoms.
2.  For both groups, node **overvaluation of weight/shape** is the most influential factor in ED networks , which mean the symptom may severely impact interpersonal network, emotion regulation, and other ED problems.

### Differences

1.  Network structures of boys and girls are significantly different in term of likelihood ratio test (LRT).
2.  Nodes of girls' network are more densely related than boys', suggesting higher likelihood of **comorbidity** for girls. 
3.  **Lack of emotional awareness** is an potential maintenance factor of boys, which is a novel finding.

## Further direction

There are more things to do to examine group differences in the longitudinal network framework:

### Global:

1. More simulation studys to validate the LRT method in examining group differences of global network structure

2. Groups may differ in network density and average edge weights. What it means in application research need more investigation? 

### Node-level:

3. Groups may differ in most important nodes but also differ in less important nodes. What that mean and how we interpret that?

4. Are group's edge weights comparable? For example, the partial correlation between node A with node B differ by groups but how to interpret that?
